'''London bike sharing dataset class for Pytorch geometric. The class builds on the Dataset parent from
Pytorch Geometric.

The raw data can be selected and transformed in several ways in order to create input and output data
situated on the graph. That includes the time interval resolution. However most important is the
way a sliding window is used on the raw data in order to create the input and output. For example, the raw
data contains two data channels per bike station (the spatial dimension) and time interval (the temporal
dimension). In a prediction task, for a given bike station, the values at the two data channels are given
for a certain number of input temporal coordinates (e.g. t3,t2,t1), and during training the value of the
two data channels at one temporal coordinate into the future is given (e.g. tX). The number of inputs and
the coordinate of the output relative the inputs define the sliding window. As that sliding window moves
over the raw data, the input and expected output for the training task are obtained. The precise number
of such data slices depend non-trivially on the inputs to the class. For that reason the class deviates in
the initialization from the template Dataset class.

class LondonBikeDataset(Dataset):
    '''The Geometric PyTorch dataset class to make raw data available for Pytorch processing, including DataLoaders

    The workflow is as this: (1) Data from the `rawdata_reformat` is taken as input, (2) sliced to create the
    input data and output data for training and stored, such that a DataLoader can construct batches for training.

    The raw data has to exist in a folder hierarchy with paths as the following format:

    `'{}/{}_{}m/{}_{}m.csv'.format(source_dir, dir_name_prefix, time_interval, raw_name_prefix, time_interval)`

    The slicing of the data into input-output pairs for supervised learning can take considerable time (minutes to hours)
    if the range of time indices is wide (1000+). Therefore the time slices are stored, such that if additional
    training is done for the same input data, the `process` can be set to `False` and prior data is used. Note that
    no validation is done to ensure the data slices are consistent with the initialization parameters. Set `process`
    to `False` with extreme caution.

    Args:
        source_dir (str): Path to source directory for input data to process. This folder has to conform to the
            folder hierarchy defined in class documentation. Typically the data content is created by a prior
            execution of `rawdata_reformat`
        root_dir (str): Path to directory where to the pickled pre-processed time slices are stored. If `process`
            is `True` the content in this directory is created anew. If `process` is `False` the content in this
            directory is only referenced. The files in this directory are not meant to be moved, read or adjusted.
        dir_name_prefix (str, optional): Prefix to data directories within the source directory. Default is `bikedata`
        raw_name_prefix (str, optional): Prefix to the data files within the data directories. Default is `dataraw`
        graph_weight_name (str, optional): File name to the weighted graph that is stored in the source directory and
            which applies to all raw data variants. Default is `graph_weight.csv`
        transform : No functionality at the moment.
        pre_transform : No functionality at the moment.
        station_id_exclusion (list, optional): If certain stations should be entirely excluded from consideration,
            provide their station IDs in a list. Default is no exclusion.
        weight_filter (float, optional): If the edges in the station-to-station graph should be pruned on basis
            of weight, provide the lower bound of weight for edges to keep. Default is no pruning.
        time_id_bounds (tuple, optional): If only data for subset of times are to be considered, provide the lower
            and upper bound time indeces as a tuple of two integers. Default is no time slicing.
        time_interval (int, optional): Which data directory to use to create the data set. The data directories are
            differentiated on the number of minutes per time interval. Default is 30.
        time_input_number(int, optional): How many contiguous time intervals of data to provide as input, the "x", to
            the model. Value must be compatible with the model architecture. Default 9.
        time_forward_pred(int, optional): How many time intervals into the future from the most recent given
            time interval given to the prediction that should be predicted by the model, the "y". Default 1.
        process (bool, optional): Flag to determine if the class initialization should create all the time slices or
            only link to already processed data in the `root_dir`. Default is `True`
